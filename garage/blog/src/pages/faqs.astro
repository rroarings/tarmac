  {
    question: "Is Trackside an official F1 website?",
    answer: "No, Trackside is an independent fan site. This website is unofficial and is not associated in any way with the Formula 1 companies. F1, FORMULA ONE, FORMULA 1, FIA FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP, GRAND PRIX and related marks are trade marks of Formula One Licensing B.V."

const raceFaqs = [
  {
    question: "Where can I find the full race calendar for each season?",
    answer: "Trackside offers fans a look back into a few of the most recent and current Formula 1 championship seasons. This includes 2024 and 2025. This site is not built with a CMS, therefore, writing that much does not sound too enjoyable. It was built to be a static site."
  },
  {
    question: "What time are Formula 1 races held?",
    answer: "We do not have the times of the races in local times. You can find the date of the race on the website but we do not provide any tools or features for time conversion."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I access race highlights and replays?",
    answer: "We do not offer any 'race highlights' or 'race replay' features through the website. Some race pages might feature some video clips of original footage captured within <i>F1 2023</i> and <i>F1 2024</i> by ourselves. These are recreations of moments in the race. To see official race highlights and replays, please refer to the official Formula 1 website."
