# Miami Grand Prix 2024

The sixth race of the 2024 Formula 1 season took place at the Miami International Autodrome. Lando Norris claimed back-to-back victories, confirming McLaren's resurgence as a top team and establishing himself as a championship contender.

## Race Highlights

- Lando Norris took his second consecutive win
- Max Verstappen started on pole but finished second after strategy issues
- Charles Leclerc secured another podium in third place
- Oscar Piastri made it a strong weekend for McLaren in fourth
- Sergio Perez recovered from a poor qualifying to finish fifth
- Both Mercedes drivers failed to score points after a difficult weekend

The race in Miami featured high temperatures and humidity, testing both drivers and machinery. A well-timed safety car period after a collision between Esteban Ocon and Nico Hulkenberg helped Norris claim the lead, which he maintained until the checkered flag.
