# Miami Grand Prix 2025

The Miami Grand Prix returns for its fifth appearance on the Formula 1 calendar, taking place around the Miami International Autodrome at the Hard Rock Stadium complex.

## Preview

### Things to Watch For

- Lewis Hamilton returns to Miami where he has enjoyed strong results in the past
- Track temperature will be a significant factor, with afternoon temperatures expected to reach 31Â°C
- The newly reprofiled turns 14-16 section should provide more overtaking opportunities
