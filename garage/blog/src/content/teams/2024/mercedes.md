## 2024 Performance

The W15 showed significant improvement over its predecessor, with the team having finally resolved the porpoising and balance issues that plagued them since the introduction of the ground effect regulations. Lewis Hamilton secured several race wins in his farewell season with the team, while George Russell demonstrated consistent pace throughout the year. The team's development rate throughout the season was particularly impressive.
